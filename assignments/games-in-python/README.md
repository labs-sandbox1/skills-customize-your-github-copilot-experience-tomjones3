# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game

## 🎯 Objective

Build a classic Hangman game in Python! Practice your skills with strings, loops, conditionals, and user input while creating a fun word-guessing challenge.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up the Game

#### Description
Create the basic structure for your Hangman game. Define a list of possible words and set up variables to track the game state.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a list of at least 5 possible words
- Randomly select a word for the player to guess

### 🛠️ Task 2: Implement Game Logic

#### Description
Write the main game loop that lets the player guess letters, updates the display, and checks for win/lose conditions.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Prompt the player to guess a letter each turn
- Show the current progress (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game with a win message if the word is guessed
- End the game with a lose message if attempts run out
